```assembly
mov eax, [ebx+0x10]
add eax, ecx
mov [edi], eax
```
In this code snippet, there's a potential for an error if the value of `ebx + 0x10` is not a valid memory address.  If `ebx` points to a location less than 0x10 bytes from the end of a segment, then the memory access will likely cause a segmentation fault or general protection fault.
